# This is my first file for an ADViCE-Jekyll trial
I want to compare whether Hugo or Jekyll is more convenient for contributing new content to the ADViCE KB. Specifically:
- Minimise number of technical steps required
- pushing changes to the repository
- seeing the changes in the website in real time
## Thoughts on Jekyll
- Seems pretty slow to update, VERY SLOW to update
- I can't get the "adding a page to your site" to work
- Further change
